# Console
This was a quick attempt at taking a console I made for debugging purposes in a game, and making it more of a framework that could be dragged and dropped into any Java application. However, I ran into roadblocks when it came to using reflection, and I am currently unable to complete this project.

# To Do
Make command loading more dynamic, possibly so that one could simple place a .jar into the commands directory and have the program scan it for commands, using the jar and internal file path for the package when loading commands.
